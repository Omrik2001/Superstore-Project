# Superstore-Project
Being a Data Analyst is much more than creating dashboards. In order to deliver value in todays market, you must have all sorts of tools in your toolbox, and be able to take on more than the scope of your job title. In this project:
1. Data was preprocessed in Python
2. Data schema was modelled using the most appropriate structure for business analysis
3. Report was created in Power BI in accordance with best visualisation practices

**Analysis**
Executive Summary:
1. Sales, Profit, Order volume are all either on track or close to our 5% growth target (monthly).
2. In a year, the performance of these KPIs bottom out in Q1 while peaking in Q4.
3. Profit Margin is generally poor, especially in the furniture category. It has seen a steady 1.5% MoM decrease.
4. Though poor PM in furniture, it has seen steady MoM growth aswell as Technology (to a lesser extent). Office supplies has seen decreasing PM and is also endangered by excessive discounting.
5. PM is higher when discount is lower. In the case of Furniture, discount is too high meaning margins are being squeezed.

Analysis:
We Might consider decreasing the discounts on Furniture and limiting increases in office supply discounts in an attempt to preserve margins.
The seasonal nature of performance is not a weakness but simply a feature of business. Can plan business activities around this.

Products & Customers
1. Customer retention is excellent, with almost 100% customers making over one order.
2. The MoM growth in customers making over one order is growing at around 1.4%.
3. Like most KPIs, total customers bottom out in Q1 while peaking in Q4.
4. Consumer customer segment is the most popular, making almost half of all profits and sales revenue.
5. 60% of ordered products fall under office supplies, with furniture then Technology next.
6. Most ordered sub-cat is binders and paper - both in office supplies.
7. Top products by ordered quantity are all in office supplies.
8. The top customer (Emily Phan) has placed 16 orders, with the next two making 12 each.

Analysis:
Overall positive. Office supplies is by far the most popular category in products ordered, also showing strong performance in the Executive summary side. We must be careful to maintain profit margins in this area as they are gradually falling. Perhaps by decreasing discount or other costs. It is important to maintain quality from this category since we specialise in this area.
Most orders are accounted for by the consumer segment, meaning customers are buying for personal use. Perhaps a strategy to target B2B sales might be favourable as orders in this segment are lower - we could provide bulk deals to businesess with office supplies, technologies and even furniture.
We might consider a rewards for top customers to encourage loyalty.
